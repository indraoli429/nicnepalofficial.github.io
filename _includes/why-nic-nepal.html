            <i>Nepal imports over 90% of the goods and exports less than 10% which results in huge trade deficit. 
            In order to make Nepal economically prosperous, we need to create products and services within the country
            itself.</i>

            <span class="text-highlight">
              Nepal must give highest priority to Science, Information Technology and Innovation in order to ensure 
              sustainable base to back the needed <i>Economic Haul</i>.
